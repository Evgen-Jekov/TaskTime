# TaskTime

Hello, I started developing this project with the goal that it will one day become quite popular for people who need to plan their time. At the moment, it is released as an MVP on PyQT and Flask.

## Prerequisites
- Python(3.10 version)

## Dependencies

I don't see any point in listing all dependencies here, so only the main ones will be named, you can find the others in requirements.txt

- FLask
- PySide6

These are the 2 fundamental frameworks for this app at the moment, they seemed perfect to me for the MVP version

## Install 

1. clone the repository: 
    `git clone https://github.com/Evgen-Jekov/TaskTime`
2. create .venv
    `python -m venv venv`
3. activate .venv
    - for Windows:
        `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    - for Linux:
        `source venv/bin/activate`
4. install dependencies
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# TaskTime

Hello, I started developing this project with the goal that it will one day become quite popular for people who need to plan their time. At the moment, it is released as an MVP on Flask.

## Prerequisites
- Python(3.10 version)

## Dependencies

I'm using the Flask framework as the core of the app, it's an MVP app, so good old Flask seemed like a good choice

## Install 

If someone wants to test my API or improve it, I wrote a guide for installation, after a while a section will be added describing what and how it works in the project so that you don't have to deal with 0
